# HACK\*MATCH for the TI-84+ CE

Game by Zachtronics

Port by euphory

Support the official release! Check out *EXAPUNKS*, an incredible open-ended programming puzzle game and good introduction to Zachtronics's catalog; *Last Call BBS*, a collection best described as several outstanding games rolled into one; or check out the NES port this is most closely based on on itch.io.

## How to Play

*HACK\*MATCH* is a match-4 game in the vein of Candy Crush, but (hopefully!) better. Move matching files into groups of 4 to remove them and score points. Files will continue to be added from the top; if they reach the bottom, it's game over!

Groups larger than 4 score bonus points. Two stars placed next to each other will destroy all matching files, but score no points. The higher your score gets, the faster the files will come!

## Controls

- Arrow keys: move EXA (cursor) left/right
- 2nd: grab/drop file
- alpha: swap top files
- clear: quit game (at any time)
